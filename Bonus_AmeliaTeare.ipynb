    "One possible application would be to take a look at how long it takes me to complete each report from start to finish and then use those data points to find how long it takes me to complete a project on average. Some projects definitely take longer than others, but on average we are expected to complete projects within a week of receiving the necessary data. By completing this calculation, I would be able to determine if I am meeting my company's expectation or not. This would be used more as a self-reflection tool. "
